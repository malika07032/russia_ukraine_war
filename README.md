Personal Project

Tools and Technologies: Python, tweepy, Twitter API, nltk, numpy, networkx, matplotlib, plotly, pandas, RegEx, sklearn, pyLDAvis, langid, gensim, seaborn, Topic Modeling

Discovered 12 prominent topics of international discourse on Twitter by collecting 2 million English-language Tweets related to Russia’s war in Ukraine and using LDA Topic Modeling in order to evaluate the influence of Russian propaganda about the war in Ukraine. (April ‘22)

I have also attached the paper that I have written using the analysis of collected data.
